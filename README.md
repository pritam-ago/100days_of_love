# 100days_of_love

From 25 December, I'll be coding for 100 days everyday. This repo is to track my progress and improvise.

25 December -
    Figured out what to learn and the structure of my learning curve. Started off with node.js, covering all its essential basics and core modules like http, fs, readline, path and events. Followed some freecodecamp tutorials and built a http server only using node.js
    Learnt express.js and built a RESTful API using node.js and express.js. It was simple but still I got the basic syntax and structure of express.js

    Key takeaways -
        Node.js core modules - http, fs, events, path and readline
        Express.js calling methods - GET, POST, DELETE, PUT
        Refer my "nodejs_lp" and "expressjs_lp" repo for a few blocks of code that I practiced during this learning process

26 December - 
    Yeah so following the completion of basics of both node.js and express.js, I've practiced it by building RESTful API's for a blog app as well as a task manager app. With that I'm confident with the basics of node and express and with that I'm moving into noSQL database(mongoDB). I've started off with some blogs and I'm about to practice it

        Key takeaways - 
            Built RESTful APIs for both blog app and task manager app
            Went through the intro of noSQL databases
            Started off with mongodb and mongoose

27 December -
    Continued with the mongols and mongoose query syntaxes and likes. Did some data operations like insert, update and deletion.
        
        Key takeaways -
             Used mongodb queries and inserted and operated data using atlas db

28 December - 
    Learnt to use express and node.js with mongodb and hence built a basic url shortener. And as I'm curious about getting that live on internet, I digged deep on how to host it on AWS, I know how to in vercel but I kinda like it complicated so just wanted to explore AWS. Created account in aws and got my console and createed a IAM user. Starting off with ubuntu and ssh, things are getting complicated even more. Ufff.... But great things wont come with ease. So I'll go through this and try to master it.

        Key takeaways - 
            Built an url shortener
            Started off with AWS and ubuntu
            Refer to the "mongodb_lp" repo for my url shortener project
29 December - 
    So yeah... rough time through AWS and decided to place it aside and complete my noSQL learning curve. Learnt about mongoDB aggregation frameworks and some advanced queries like gt, lt, or, and, etc...
Much more to learn in mongoDB and I'm planning to start an intermediate level project which covers almost every feature I have to know about node.js, express.js and mongoDB. I"ve been brainstorming few ideas lately. Will be finalizing it tonight. It will cover concepts like JWT auth and likes, so From today Everything I learn and build will be in reference to the project. Roughly by 30 or 40days I'll be completing the project and master all the essential elements of backend. About to use MERN stack.

        Key takeaways - 
            Brainstorming a project idea with which I'll be learning MERN stack
            Estimated project deadline is about 30-40 days i.e by the end of January or February 1st week

30 December -
    Figured out what project to start with and it's a donation platform where people can raise causes and donate for causes others create. It's structure and schemas are under planning and as the first and most important step, revised the commands of git. 

        Key takeaways - 
            Learnt git commands
            Started a project, a donation platform
            Created basic folder structures and database connection, and also basic routes setup using express and node
