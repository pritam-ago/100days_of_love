# 100days_of_love

From 25 December, I'll be coding for 100 days everyday. This repo is to track my progress and improvise.

25 December -
    Figured out what to learn and the structure of my learning curve. Started off with node.js, covering all its essential basics and core modules like http, fs, readline, path and events. Followed some freecodecamp tutorials and built a http server only using node.js
    Learnt express.js and built a RESTful API using node.js and express.js. It was simple but still I got the basic syntax and structure of express.js

    Key takeaways -
        Node.js core modules - http, fs, events, path and readline
        Express.js calling methods - GET, POST, DELETE, PUT
        Refer my "nodejs_lp" and "expressjs_lp" repo for a few blocks of code that I practiced during this learning process
